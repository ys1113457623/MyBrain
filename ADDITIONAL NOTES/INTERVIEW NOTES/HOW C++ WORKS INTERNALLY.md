## STEPS

- ### C++ CODE
	- When you write a c++ program
- ### PREPROCESSING
	- Handles #includes and #define before actual compilation
	- Think of like copy pasting the #includes  and #define code
- ### COMPILATION
	- Translates C++ code into assembly language 
- ### ASSEMBLY
	- Assembler turns assembly language into machine code
- ### OBJECT FILE CREATION
	- You now have a .o or .obj file with raw instructions but its not complete yet.
- ### LINKING
	- If your program users libraries like iostream the linker pulls in the required compiled code from the libraries and combines it with your compiled code into a single executable 
- ### EXECUTION
	- The OS loads the program in RAM
	- The CPU starts executing machine instruction line by line
	- Instructions manipulate registers and memory 
	- Output happens via system calls
